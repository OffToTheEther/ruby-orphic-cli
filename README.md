## Installation

You'll need Ruby and Rubygems installed for this to work. [Google is your friend](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=install+ruby+and+rubygems). If those steps are complete, you can install the gem locally with `gem install orphic-cli`. To build from source, clone the repo, access the directory and run `bundle install`.
